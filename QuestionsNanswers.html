    <h2>1. What is TCP/IP?</h2>
    <p>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of networking protocols that allows communication between computers and devices over the internet and other networks. It manages how data is broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed, received, and reassembled to ensure reliable and efficient communication.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TCP</strong> is responsible for ensuring that data packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.</li>
      <li><strong>IP</strong> handles the addressing and routing of data packets, ensuring they reach the correct destination.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>TCP/IP is a set of rules that allows computers to communicate with each other over the internet. It handles the sending and receiving of data packets between devices.</p>

    <h2>2. What is an IP Address?</h2>
    <p>An <strong>IP address</strong> is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network for communication. It identifies the device's location in the network. There are two main versions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IPv4</strong></li>
      <li><strong>IPv6</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. What is a Firewall?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>Firewall</strong> prevents connection between two or more sources. It basically blocks any incoming or outgoing traffic. Firewalls help prevent unauthorized access, protect against malware, and enforce network security policies. They can be hardware or software-based.</p>

    <h2>4. What is a VPN?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>VPN</strong> (Virtual Private Network) allows users to create a secure connection over public networks such as the Internet.</p>

    <h2>5. What is DNS?</h2>
    <p><strong>DNS</strong> (Domain Name System) translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load those Internet resources through the Internet protocol.</p>

    <h2>6. What is DHCP?</h2>
    <p><strong>DHCP</strong> (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and other network configuration settings to devices on a network. DHCP simplifies network management by eliminating the need to manually configure each device's IP settings, making it scalable and efficient.</p>

    <h2>7. What is Network Topology?</h2>
    <p><strong>Network topology</strong> is a physical layout of the computer network and it defines how the computers, devices, cables, etc. are connected to each other.</p>

    <h2>8. What is Ping?</h2>
    <p><strong>Ping</strong> is a network utility used to test connectivity and measure response time between two devices on an IP network. It helps diagnose network connectivity issues, assess network performance, and troubleshoot latency problems.</p>

    <h2>9. What is Traceroute?</h2>
    <p><strong>Traceroute</strong> (also known as tracert on Windows) is a network diagnostic tool used to track the path that data packets take from your computer to a destination server or host on the internet. It helps you understand the route or "hops" that your data takes, which can be useful for troubleshooting network connectivity issues, identifying latency or bottlenecks, and understanding the network topology between your computer and the target server.</p>

    <h2>10. What is a Router?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>Router</strong> is a device that manages the flow of data to multiple connected devices. It is a network device that connects two or more network segments.</p>

    <h2>11. What is a Default Gateway?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>Default Gateway</strong> is a network device, usually a router, that allows devices within a network to communicate with devices in other networks by serving as the entry or exit point for data traffic.</p>

    <h2>12. What is a MAC Address?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>MAC</strong> (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller of a device. It is a 12-digit hexadecimal number that helps identify the device on a local network.</p>

    <h2>13. What is Active Directory?</h2>
    <p><strong>Active Directory</strong> is a Microsoft service that manages and organizes network resources like users, computers, and groups in a Windows network. It provides a secure way for users to log in, access authorized resources, and enables centralized management for administrators.</p>

    <h2>14. What is a Domain?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>Domain</strong> is a logical grouping of network resources, including computers, servers, and user accounts, that share a common set of rules and policies. It enables centralized management and administration of these resources within a network.</p>
