## FAQ and IT Concepts

# Networking Concepts

## 1. What is TCP/IP?
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of networking protocols that allows communication between computers and devices over the internet and other networks. It manages how data is broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed, received, and reassembled to ensure reliable and efficient communication.
- **TCP** is responsible for ensuring that data packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.
- **IP** handles the addressing and routing of data packets, ensuring they reach the correct destination.

TCP/IP is a set of rules that allows computers to communicate with each other over the internet. It handles the sending and receiving of data packets between devices.

## 2. What is an IP Address?
An **IP address** is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network for communication. It identifies the device's location in the network. There are two main versions:
- **IPv4** 
- **IPv6**

## 3. What is a Firewall?
A **Firewall** prevents connection between two or more sources. It basically blocks any incoming or outgoing traffic. Firewalls help prevent unauthorized access, protect against malware, and enforce network security policies. They can be hardware or software-based.

## 4. What is a VPN?
A **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) allows users to create a secure connection over public networks such as the Internet.

## 5. What is DNS?
**DNS** (Domain Name System) translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load those Internet resources through the Internet protocol.

## 6. What is DHCP?
**DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and other network configuration settings to devices on a network. DHCP simplifies network management by eliminating the need to manually configure each device's IP settings, making it scalable and efficient.

## 7. What is Network Topology?
**Network topology** is a physical layout of the computer network and it defines how the computers, devices, cables, etc. are connected to each other.

## 8. What is Ping?
**Ping** is a network utility used to test connectivity and measure response time between two devices on an IP network. It helps diagnose network connectivity issues, assess network performance, and troubleshoot latency problems.

## 9. What is Traceroute?
**Traceroute** (also known as tracert on Windows) is a network diagnostic tool used to track the path that data packets take from your computer to a destination server or host on the internet. It helps you understand the route or "hops" that your data takes, which can be useful for troubleshooting network connectivity issues, identifying latency or bottlenecks, and understanding the network topology between your computer and the target server.

## 10. What is a Router?
A **Router** is a device that manages the flow of data to multiple connected devices. It is a network device that connects two or more network segments.

## 11. What is a Default Gateway?

## Additional IT Troubleshooting Scenarios

### 44. TCP
- **Three-way handshaking**:
  1. Client sends a SYN segment to the server, asking for synchronization (like "hello server, can you open the connection for me").
  2. The server replies with SYN-ACK (server acknowledges the client and asks the client to open the connection too).
  3. The client replies with ACK, confirming the connection.
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, ensuring reliable and ordered data transfer between devices. It guarantees error-checking, acknowledgment, and retransmission mechanisms, making it more reliable but slightly slower than UDP.

## 45. UDP

**Description:**
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol, meaning it does not establish a direct connection before transmitting data. It is faster and more efficient than TCP since it does not have the overhead of establishing and maintaining a connection. 

**Key Points:**
- Does not guarantee data delivery, order, or error-checking.
- A "best-effort" protocol.
- Ideal for real-time applications where speed is crucial, such as streaming, online gaming, and VoIP.
- Tolerates occasional data loss.
